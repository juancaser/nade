# Not Another dotEnv function helper

There a lot of ways to do this but this snippet i use for most of my projects, i tend to keep it simple and avoid complicated implementation.

## How to setup

1) Create .env file and add your variable in there 
2) Include dotenv.php and make sure it is loaded first, the function built-in php function parse_ini_file and getenv
2) Thats it
